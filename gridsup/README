The gridsup package enables the display of records in a grid from a database.

The database must be a subclass of DBapi (basesup/dbapi.py) or DPTapi (basesup/dptapi.py).

The gridsup package classes support the display of lists of objects from records on the database ordered by index; and editing or deleting existing records; and inserting new records.

The six point Howto for using this package is:

Define a grid as a subclass of DataGrid (datagrid.py).
Define a record description in a subclass of Record (basesup/api/record.py)
Define the layout of a row in a subclass of DataRow (gridsup/gui/datarow.py) which is also a subclass of a record description.
Define the layout of a row using Python Tkinter classes.
Insert or edit records using a subclass of DataEdit (gridsup/gui/dataedit.py).
Delete records using a subclass of DataDelete (gridsup/gui/datadelete.py).
